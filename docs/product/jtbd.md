# JTBD: Prompt Playground for Delegation Practice

Repository: codex-in-plain-english

## Core Job Statement

When I have learned Codex basics but still feel unsure, I want to practice writing delegation prompts in a safe environment, so I can confidently use Codex in real work without guessing.

## Primary Jobs

1. Practice transforming a vague request into a well-structured prompt.
2. Validate prompt quality quickly before trying real tasks outside the course.

## Job Steps

| Step | Current friction | Desired progress |
|---|---|---|
| Discover | Learner sees concepts but no practice sandbox | Learner finds a clear "Practice" entry point |
| Decide | Unsure what a "good" prompt includes | Learner sees scenario + rubric criteria |
| Execute | Writes prompt blindly | Writes prompt with visible structure expectations |
| Verify | No objective quality check | Gets immediate pass/fail with specific gaps |
| Maintain | Forgets pattern later | Can revisit scenarios and reuse prompt structure |

## Outcome Expectations

- Speed: learner can complete one practice cycle in under 10 minutes.
- Confidence: learner reports clearer understanding of prompt structure.
- Control: learner can intentionally improve a draft instead of random rewrites.

## Forces of Adoption

### Push (pain)

- Fear of writing bad prompts and wasting time.
- Low confidence moving from theory to practice.

### Pull (benefits)

- Safe, repeatable practice before real usage.
- Clear rubric that explains what strong prompts contain.

### Anxiety (risk)

- Concern that feedback is generic or inaccurate.
- Concern that practice may feel disconnected from real tasks.

### Habits (status quo)

- Skipping practice and jumping directly to trial-and-error with real tools.

## Evidence Links

- User quote / ticket: TODO add once first feedback round is collected.
- Interview / note: TODO add from post-launch learner interviews.
