  { module: 'Module 1', takeaway: 'Most digital work is repeatable. Codex helps you move from clicking steps to declaring outcomes.' },
  { module: 'Module 2', takeaway: 'Codex can plan, script, execute, and retry technical tasks while you focus on intent and review.' },
  { module: 'Module 3', takeaway: 'AI work usually runs through code or through UI interaction; code mode is often faster and more reliable.' },
  { module: 'Module 4', takeaway: 'Good delegation starts with clear scope, constraints, and acceptance checks, not fancy prompts.' },
  { module: 'Module 5', takeaway: 'Skills are reusable prompt workflows packaged in folders with references and tooling.' },
  { module: 'Module 6', takeaway: 'Progressive disclosure keeps context lean: the agent opens detailed instructions only when needed.' },
  { module: 'Module 7', takeaway: 'Teams get consistency by encoding habits into shared skills instead of relying on individual memory.' },
  { module: 'Module 8', takeaway: 'Adoption works best when you start small, measure outcomes, and iterate your workflows openly.' },

  'Pick one repetitive weekly task and write a plain-language delegation brief for it.',
  'Run the task once with Codex and capture what failed, what succeeded, and what to clarify.',
  'Create or adapt one skill folder so future runs are consistent.',
  'Share your workflow with a teammate and ask them to run it end to end.',
  'Refine your acceptance checks so the output is reviewable in under two minutes.',
